initng-usplash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to use:

initng-usplash currently works only for Ubuntu, make sure the usplash package 
is installed.
Then open /boot/grub/menu.lst and add "init=/sbin/initng-usplash" to the
kernel line. Make sure you also have the "splash" boot parameter.
As a last step, add usplash to your default runlevel:
# ng-update add usplash


/Jimmy.
