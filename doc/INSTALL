Installation Instructions
*************************

For the most up-to-date installation instructions, please refer to the initng
wiki: http://www.initng.org/wiki/Installation

As of version 0.6.4, GNU autotools support has been completely removed.
To compile initng, you will need CMake version 2.2.0 or later.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================
* A computer running linux (support for BSD-based operating systems is under
development) on one of the following architectures: alpha, amd64, hppa, i386,
ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, ppc, sparc. (others may or may not work).
* GNU GCC 3.4.x, 4.0.x or 4.1.x
* CMake 2.2.0 or newer
* ncurses development libs (optional)


COMPILING INITNG
================
To avoid any potential problems during compilation, you need to create a
'build' directory for compiled code after unpacking the tarball.

--Release versions
# tar zxvf initng-version.tar.gz
# cd initng-version
# mkdir build
# cd build

--SVN Trunk
# svn co https://svn.initng.org/initng/trunk initng
# cd initng
# mkdir build
# cd build

Run cmake (replaces ./configure).  Note if you need to manually disable plugins
it can be done here.

# cmake .. [-DPLUGIN_NAME=(ON|OFF)]
(PLUGIN_NAME will be of the form BUILD_NGCS)

To faciliate easier selection of plugins, cmake offers an ncurses-based menu,
which is accessed with 'ccmake'

# ccmake ..

To compile initng, run 'make' in the usual manner

# make

Obtain root priveledges in the standard manner for your distribution, and run
'make install' to install initng.

# make install


Install initng-ifiles before continuing with configuration.


CONFIGURING INITNG
==================

1: Bootloader
-------------

LILO:
Edit lilo.conf and add the 'append' line shown below.

  image = /boot/vmlinuz
    root = /dev/hda6
    label = linux-initng
    append = "init=/sbin/initng"
    read-only

GRUB:
Edit the grub configuration file, /boot/grub/grub.conf or /boot/grub/menu.lst
depepending on your distribution and add init=/sbin/initng to the kernel entry.

  title linux-initng
  root (hd0,1)
  kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hda6 init=/sbin/initng

Grub also allows options specifying a runlevel, and optionally disabling one
service from the bootloader.

  title linux-initng runlevel:single +system/modules -net/lo
  root (hd1,0)
  kernel /kernel-2.6.16-gentoo-r1 root=/dev/sda2 init=/sbin/initng \
        runlevel:single +system/modules -net/lo


Now you are ready to install the official initng ifiles.
