FAQ: Next Generation Init System (initng)
=========================================


    NOTE: initng is in heavy development at present and the following may no
    longer apply.  Even this document is likely to undergo major changes.

    For installation instructions see the INSTALLATION and README files.

    Q: It loads up to <service> and just sits there, at about 98% complete.

---------------

Q: It loads up to <service> and just sits there, at about 98% complete.

A: It may be finished booting. Initng doesn't load xdm/gdm/kdm by default,
   and tty1 doesn't have an interactive terminal (getty) attached.

   Press Alt+F2 to get to a login prompt.

-----

Q: How do I load [xdm/gdm/kdm] by default?

A: After the system finished booting, press Alt-F2 to get a login prompt and
   login as root. Use ng-update to add the display manager to your runlevel.

# ng-update add daemon/xdm default
# ng-update add daemon/gdm default
# ng-update add daemon/kdm default

   To launch the display manage without rebooting, use ngc.

# ngc -u daemon/xdm
# ngc -u daemon/gdm
# ngc -u daemon/kdm

Q: When [xdm/gdm/kdm] tries to load, it gives an error and dies.  If I wait
   for the system to finish booting and manually start gdm, it works.

A: The system needs to wait for the video drivers to load before starting gdm.

   Possible answer: in my system, the nvidia binary must be loaded manually
   before launching gdm. Try editing /etc/initng/daemon/gdm.i and change the
   line:

depends = system/initial system/checkroot system/hostname net/lo

   to say:

depends = system/initial system/checkroot system/hostname net/lo system/coldplug

   [Note: changed since version 0.0.7; needs updating.]

-----

Q: If I add the line "init=/sbin/initng" to the end of the kernel line in
   lilo.conf, running 'lilo' complains that it is an invalid configuration
   option.

A: You need to add it on the next line as: append="init=/sbin/initng".  See
   the README for installation instructions and examples.
