Description of InitNG versioning scheme

    InitNG versions looks like this: x.y.z[_pre#|.p]

    Where an change in:
      x.o.o - means a complete or major rewrite of the core.
      o.y.o - major changes to the core, and important plugin api changes.
      o.o.z - minor changes to the core, changes in plugins, and fixes.
      _pre# - a pre-release, it's unfinished, so use with care.
      .p    - a bugfix release, doesn't introduces new features.

    You should consider any release as unstable unless we say it's stable.
    After a stable release, following releases of the same branch should be
    considered stable too.

    For example:
        0.8.4   - unstable
        0.8.4.1 - stable
        0.8.4.2 - stable

        0.8.5   - stable
        0.8.5.1 - stable

        0.8.6   - unstable
        0.8.6.1 - unstable
        0.8.6.2 - stable
        0.8.6.3 - stable
        ...
