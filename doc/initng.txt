An overview of initng:

On boot, initng will be started as the first process (PID 1) by the
kernel. At first, initng will parse configuration files located in
/etc/initng for critical information such as runlevel and service data.
After that, all services required by the default runlevel will be started as
soon as their dependencies are met, allowing services to run in parallel.
This asynchronous execution can dramatically improve boot time by better
utilizing the system resources (especially in the case of multiprocessor
systems).

Features:

* Automatic restarting of services that crash
* Easy starting, stopping, listing services through ngc
* Easy adding/removing services from a runlevel through ng-update
* SPEED!



Installing initng:

NOTE: a considerable amount of this information is outdated, see the
README and INSTALLATION files for the most up to date information


For those of you that would like to use portage:

    ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~ARCH" emerge initng 

(Please note you need to replace ~ARCH with your architecture ex: ~x86 ~ppc and
others).

If you want the latest version and have subversion installed:

    # svn checkout http://jw.dyndns.org/initng/svn/initng/trunk initng
    # cd initng 
    # ./autogen.sh
    # ./configure
    # make install

You can also install initng from the source

    # tar -zxvf initng*.tar.gz
    # cd initng*
    # ./configure
    # make install



Configuring Grub:

Basically all you need to do here is add "init=/sbin/initng" to the line
that starts with "kernel"

Before:

    title=Gentoo Linux 2.6.12
    root (hd0,0)
    kernel /kernel-2.6.12-2  root=/dev/hdc3

After:

    title=Gentoo Linux 2.6.12
    root (hd0,0)
    kernel /kernel-2.6.12-2  root=/dev/hdc3 init=/sbin/initng

Configuring and using initng:

First off you need to reboot your linux install inorder to do the following
(Please remember to boot into the one that uses initng). On the first
console you will notice that you cannot log in and that you see 100% (If you
do not please don't panic).

Now hit alt+F2 and proceed to login

If you didn't see 100%, then type

    # ngc -s | less

If you see anything that did not start up or has a waiting for dependency
next to it please make note of it. Somethings are trivial and can just be
removed (ex: keymaps and consolefont).

To remove the failed application:

    # ng-update del failedapplication



Adding or removing services from a run level:

First: Figure out the name of your service you can do this by looking
through the /etc/initng folder (files ending in .i are services)

To add a service to a runlevel:

    ng-update add service runlevel

Examples:

    # ng-update add daemon/sshd default
    # ng-update add system/alsasound default

To remove a service from a runlevel:

    ng-update del service runlevel

The runlevel part is optional but if you leave it out it removes it from all
the runlevels its on.

Examples:

    # ng-update del daemon/sshd
    # ng-update del system/alsasound default
    # ng-update del daemon/sshd
    # ng-update del system/alsasound



Starting or Stopping a service:

First: Figure out the name of your service you can do this by looking
through the /etc/initng folder (files ending in .i are services)

Starting a service:

    ngc -u service

Example:

    # ngc -u daemon/sshd

Stopping a service:

    ngc -d service

Example:

    # ngc -d daemon/sshd



Listing all services:

This lets you list all the services that are running which is particularly
useful for troubleshooting and such matters.

    # ngc -s



To flush service data:

This lets you flush memory service data, and reload from disc.

    ngc -r service

Example:

    # ngc -r daemon/sshd



Zapping a service

This lets you kill a service especially if stopping it won't work

    ngc -z service

Example:

    # ngc -z daemon/sshd



Troubleshooting

Mouse problems with X.org:

As of this time /dev/mouse does not exist. Inorder to get around this please
change the path the mouse is on in your xorg.conf file from /dev/mouse to
/dev/psaux.

Before:

    Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier "Mouse1"
        Driver	"mouse"
        Option "Protocol"     "IMPS/2"
        Option "Device"       "/dev/mouse"
        Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
    EndSection

After:

    Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier "Mouse1"
        Driver	"mouse"
        Option "Protocol"     "IMPS/2"
        Option "Device"       "/dev/psaux"
        Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
    EndSection


Nvidia Troubles:

At this point in time I have not been able to get the nvidia drivers that
are in portage to work on initng. So the solution is to download the drivers
from the nvidia website and install them.

    # modprobe -r nvidia
    # sh NVIDIA*
    # modprobe nvidia

After you have done those things you should just be able to start xorg by
doing:

    # startx
