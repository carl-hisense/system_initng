Describes the difference when searching for a service in active_db o service_db.

Using: find_by_exect_name(net/eth0)
Will:  Return the exact hit "net/eth0" only.
Equal: strcmp(pattern, string)==0

Using: find_by_name(net/eth*)
Will:  Return a hit like "net/eth0", BUT! The '/' must be right.
Equal: service_match(string, pattern)

Using: find_in_name(eth)
Will:  Return a hit like "net/eth0", because eth contains in "net/eth0" string.
	   The real difference is that the '/' chars dont have to be right.
Equal: match_in_service(string, pattern)
