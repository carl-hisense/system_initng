   description : A service means a object with an start and optionally an stop
                 command.  Unlike a daemon, which executes and continues to
                 run, a service executes, performs an action, then terminates.
                 A successful service will be given state UP.  If a stop
                 command/script is specified, it will be used to terminate the
                 service and state DOWN will be set.
