   description : After a service is parsed, initng may parse an environment
                 file and add these entries to the db.  Files specified by
                 env_file should contain variable declarations only, in the
                 form FOO="bar".  Shellscript in an env_file will NOT be
                 processed, to use a file with scripting, you will need to
                 source it within an 'exec start' or similar code block.
