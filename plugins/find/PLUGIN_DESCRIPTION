   description : When starting a new service, initng usually needs the
                 full daemon/service/subservice path and will fail if it is not
                 found.  This plugin will search the /etc/initng dir, so
                 'ngc -u subservice' can start "daemon/service/subservice".
                 The plugin also supports an alias file where you can store
                 arbitary conversions, for example to start "animals/pig" on
                 executing "ngc -u animals/cow"
